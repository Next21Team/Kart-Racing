AMX Mod X plugin for Counter-Strike.

Kart Racing — arcade racing at crazy speeds. There are items scattered on the racing tracks that allow you to temporarily upgrade your kart and build traps for rivals. There are also many characters to choose from with the possibility of repainting.

## Controls
In addition to the default buttons for moving the car along the highway, the following actions are available in the game:

* **Use the collected item** - "use" (E).
* **Skide** - Jump (spacebar) + forward + turn.
* **Jump** - Hold "duck" (Ctrl) and release it after a while (the strength of the jump depends on the time of pressing the key).
* **Look back** - Hold down the right mouse button or press on "drop" (G).
* **Reset the car to the checkpoint** - Press and hold "reload" (R).
* **Beep** - "impulse 100" (F).
* **Go to the character selection menu** - "chooseteam" (M).

## Cvars
- ```kart_laps_num "3"``` Number of laps in the race.
- ```kart_reverse_available "0"``` Enable the race in the opposite direction.
- ```kart_start_waiting_time "45"``` Waiting time (seconds) for other players before starting the game.
